### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet will assign a phone number to a user or a resource account (online application instance).

  **Note**: The cmdlet is currently not supported for customers and tenants that are or have been enabled for Regionally Hosted Meetings for Skype for Business Online. These
  customers should continue to use the Set-CsUser, Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser, Set-CsOnlineApplicationInstance, or Set-CsOnlineVoiceApplicationInstance cmdlets.
module: MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell
notes: |-
  The cmdlet is available in Teams PowerShell module 3.0.0 or later.

  If a user or resource account has a phone number set in Active Directory on-premises and synched into Microsoft 365, you can't use Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment to set the phone
  number. You will have to clear the phone number from the on-premises Active Directory and let that change sync into Microsoft 365 first.

  The previous command for assigning phone numbers to users Set-CsUser had the parameter HostedVoiceMail. Setting HostedVoiceMail for Microsoft Teams users is no longer
  necessary and that is why the parameter is not available on Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment.
