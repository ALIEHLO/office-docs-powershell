parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AdminDisplayName
  description: |+
    The AdminDisplayName parameter specifies a description for the policy. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowClickThrough
  description: |+
    The AllowClickThrough parameter specifies whether to allow users to click through to the original URL on warning pages. Valid values are:

    $true: The user is allowed to click through to the original URL. This is the default value.
    $false: The user isn't allowed to click through to the original URL.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DeliverMessageAfterScan
  description: |+
    The DeliverMessageAfterScan parameter specifies whether to deliver email messages only after Safe Links scanning is complete. Valid values are:

    - $true: Wait until Safe Links scanning is complete before delivering the message. Messages that contain malicious links are not delivered.
    - $false: If Safe Links scanning can't complete, deliver the message anyway. This is the default value.

  name: DisableUrlRewrite
  description: |+
    The DisableUrlRewrite parameter specifies whether to rewrite (wrap) URLs in email messages. Valid values are:

    - $true: URLs in messages are not rewritten, but messages are still scanned by Safe Links prior to delivery. Time of click checks on links are done using the Safe Links API in supported Outlook clients (currently, Outlook for Windows and Outlook for Mac). Typically, we don't recommend using this value.
    - $false: URLs in messages are rewritten. API checks still occur on unwrapped URLs in supported clients if the user is in a valid Safe Links policy. This is the default value.

- type: <xref href="MultiValuedProperty" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DoNotRewriteUrls
  description: |+
    The DoNotRewriteUrls parameter specifies the URLs that are not rewritten by Safe Links scanning. The list of entries allows users who are included in the policy to access the specified URLs that would otherwise be blocked by Safe Links.

    You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

    For details about the entry syntax, see [Entry syntax for the "Do not rewrite the following URLs" list](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links#entry-syntax-for-the-do-not-rewrite-the-following-urls-list).

  Safe Links is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. When a user clicks a link in a message, the URL is temporarily rewritten and checked against a list of known, malicious web sites. Safe Links includes the URL trace reporting feature to help determine who has clicked through to a malicious web site.
