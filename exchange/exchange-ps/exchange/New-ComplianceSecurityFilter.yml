### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is functional only in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

  Use the New-ComplianceSecurityFilter cmdlet to create compliance security filters in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. These filters allow specified users to search only a subset of mailboxes and SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business sites in your Microsoft 365 organization.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="ComplianceSecurityFilterActionType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Action parameter specifies that type of search action that the filter is applied to. Valid values are:

    - Export: The filter is applied when exporting search results, or preparing them for analysis in Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery.
    - Preview: The filter is applied when previewing search results.
    - Purge: The filter is applied when purging search results. How the items are deleted is controlled by the PurgeType parameter value on the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet. The default value is SoftDelete, which means the purged items are recoverable by users until the deleted items retention period expires.
    - Search: The filter is applied when running a search.
    - All: The filter is applied to all search actions.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Security & Compliance Center
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: Filters
  description: |+
    The Filters parameter specifies the search criteria for the compliance security filter. The filters are applied to the users specified by the Users parameter. You can create three different types of filters:

    - Mailbox filter: Specifies the mailboxes that can be searched by the assigned users. Valid syntax is `Mailbox_<MailboxPropertyName>`, where `<MailboxPropertyName>` is a mailbox property value. For example,`"Mailbox_CustomAttribute10 -eq 'OttawaUsers'"` allows users to only search mailboxes that have the value OttawaUsers in the CustomAttribute10 property. For a list of supported mailbox properties, see [Filterable properties for the RecipientFilter parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/recipientfilter-properties).
    - Mailbox content filter: Specifies the mailbox content the assigned users can search for. Valid syntax is `MailboxContent_<SearchablePropertyName>`, where `<SearchablePropertyName>` specifies a Keyword Query Language (KQL) property that can be specified in a compliance search. For example, `"MailboxContent_Recipients -like 'contoso.com'"` allows users to only search for messages sent to recipients in the contoso.com domain. For a list of searchable email properties, see [Keyword queries for eDiscovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/keyword-queries-and-search-conditions#searchable-email-properties).
    - Site and site content filter: There are two SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business site-related filters that you can create: `Site_<SearchableSiteProperty>` (specifies site-related properties. For example,`"Site_Path -eq 'https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/doctors'"` allows users to only search for content in the `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/doctors` site collection) and `SiteContent_<SearchableSiteProperty>` (specifies content-related properties. For example, `"SiteContent_FileExtension -eq 'docx'"` allows users to only search for Word documents). For a list of searchable site properties, see [Overview of crawled and managed properties in SharePoint Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/technical-reference/crawled-and-managed-properties-overview). Properties marked with a Yes in the Queryable column can be used to create a site or site content filter.

    You can specify multiple filters of the same type. For example, `"Mailbox_CustomAttribute10 -eq 'FTE' -and Mailbox_MemberOfGroup -eq '$($DG.DistinguishedName)'"`.

    You have to create a search permissions filter to explicitly prevent users from searching any content location in a specific Microsoft 365 service (such as preventing a user from searching Exchange mailboxes or SharePoint sites). In other words, creating a search permissions filter that allows a user to search all SharePoint sites in the organization doesn't prevent that user from searching mailboxes. For example, to allow a SharePoint admin to only search SharePoint sites, you have to create a filter that prevents them from mailboxes (see Example 9). Similarly, to allow an Exchange admin to only search mailboxes, you have to create a filter that prevents them from searching sites.

    - The value All: Assigns the filter to all users. You can only use this value by itself.

  Compliance security filters work with compliance searches in the Microsoft 365 compliance center (\*-ComplianceSearch cmdlets), not In-Place eDiscovery searches in Exchange Online (\*-MailboxSearch cmdlets).

  To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance Center PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).
