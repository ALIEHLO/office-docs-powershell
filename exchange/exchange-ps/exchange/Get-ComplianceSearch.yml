  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Case
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The Case parameter filters the results by the name of a Core eDiscovery case that the compliance search is associated with. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks.

    You can't use this parameter to view compliance searches associated with Advanced eDiscovery cases.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Fqdn" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="ComplianceSearchIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the compliance search that you want to view.

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the compliance search. For example:

    - Name
    - JobRunId (GUID)

    You can find these values by running the command Get-ComplianceSearch | Format-Table -Auto Name,JobRunId,Status

    To improve the performance of this cmdlet, some compliance search properties aren't returned if you don't specify the identity of the compliance search. These properties are:

    - Items
    - Size
    - SuccessResults
    - NumBindings
    - ExchangeLocation
    - SharePointLocation
    - OneDriveLocation

    To view these properties, you need to use the Identity parameter in the command.

  name: ResultSize
