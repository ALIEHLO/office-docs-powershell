parameters:
- type: <xref href="ComplianceSecurityFilterActionType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    The Action parameter filters the results by the type of search action that a filter is applied to. Valid values are:

    - All
    - Export
    - Preview
    - Purge
    - Search

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Security & Compliance Center
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Security & Compliance Center

    The User parameter filters the results by the user who gets a filter applied to their searches. Valid values are:
