### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Online Protection.

  Use the Set-EOPDistributionGroup cmdlet to modify distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups in standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes. This cmdlet isn't available in EOP that's included with Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services licenses in on-premises Exchange; use the Set-DistributionGroup cmdlet instead.

  Typically, standalone EOP organizations that also have on-premises Active Directory use directory synchronization to create users and groups in EOP. However, if you can't use directory synchronization, then you can use cmdlets to create and manage users and groups in EOP.

  This cmdlet uses a batch processing method that results in a propagation delay of a few minutes before the results of the cmdlet are visible.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

    - $, &, ', \`, {, }, and \| need to be escaped (for example ``-Alias what`'snew``) or the entire value enclosed in single quotation marks (for example, `-Alias 'what'snew'`). The & character is not supported in the Alias value for Azure AD Connect synchronization.
    - Periods (.) must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`).
    - Unicode characters U+00A1 to U+00FF.

  name: Identity
  description: |+
    The Identity parameter specifies the distribution group or mail-enabled security group that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ManagedBy
  description: |+
    The ManagedBy parameter specifies one or more group owners. A group must have at least one owner. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the owner. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Domain\\Username
    - Email address
    - GUID
    - LegacyExchangeDN
    - SamAccountName
    - User ID or user principal name (UPN)

    You can specify multiple owners by using the following syntax: `@("Owner1","Owner2",..."OwnerN")`. The values that you specify will overwrite the current list of owners.

    The users specified with the ManagedBy parameter aren't automatically members of the distribution group. If you want any of the owners to be added as members of the distribution group, you need to add them by using the Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember cmdlet.
