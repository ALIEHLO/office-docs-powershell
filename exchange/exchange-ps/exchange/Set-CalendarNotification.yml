### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

  The Set-CalendarNotification cmdlet allows users to set text message notification options for calendar events in their own calendar. By default, the MyTextMessaging end-user role gives access to this cmdlet, so admins can't configure text messaging notification for calendar events in user calendars.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CalendarUpdateNotification
  description: |+
    The CalendarUpdateNotification parameter specifies whether calendar update notifications are sent to the user's mobile device. Valid values are:

    - $true: Calendar update notifications are enabled.
    - $false: Calendar update notifications aren't enabled. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Server 2010
  - Exchange Server 2013
  - Exchange Server 2016
  - Exchange Server 2019
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CalendarUpdateSendDuringWorkHour
  description: |+
    The CalendarUpdateSendDuringWorkHour parameter specifies whether calendar update notifications are only sent to the user's mobile device during working hours. Valid values are:

    - $true: Calendar update notifications are only sent during working hours.
    - $false: Calendar update notifications are sent anytime. This is the default value.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.
