parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Case
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Case parameter specifies the name of the eDiscovery case that you want to modify. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks (").

    To see the available eDiscovery cases, use the Get-ComplianceCase cmdlet.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

    - Canonical DN
    - GUID
