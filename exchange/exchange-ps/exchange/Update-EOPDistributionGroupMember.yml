### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Online Protection.

  Use the Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember cmdlet to add or remove members from distribution groups and mail-enabled security groups in standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes. This cmdlet isn't available in EOP that's included with Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services licenses in on-premises Exchange; use the Update-DistributionGroupMember cmdlet instead.

  Typically, standalone EOP organizations that also have on-premises Active Directory use directory synchronization to create users and groups in EOP. However, if you can't use directory synchronization, then you can use cmdlets to create and manage users and groups in EOP.

  This cmdlet uses a batch processing method that results in a propagation delay of a few minutes before the results of the cmdlet are visible.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

- title: Example 2

    $CurrentMemberObjects = Get-DistributionGroupMember "Security Team"
    $CurrentMemberNames = $CurrentMemberObjects | % {$_.name}

    Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember -Identity "Security Team" -Members $CurrentMemberNames
  description: |-
    This example adds a new user named Tyson Fawcett to the distribution group named Security Team while preserving the current members of the group. The current member objects are retrieved in a collection, the collection is filtered to extract the names, the user "Tyson Fawcett" is added, and the updated name list replaces the current membership of the distribution group.

    The Members parameter specifies the list of recipients (mail-enabled objects) in the distribution group or mail-enabled security group. In Exchange Online Protection, the valid recipient types are:

    - Mail users
    - Distribution groups
    - Mail-enabled security groups

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    To replace the current members of the group with the recipients that you specify, use the syntax `@("Recipient1","Recipient2",..."RecipientN")`. To add new group members without affecting the existing members, see Example 2 in the Examples section.
