  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

    - Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
    - Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

  name: DomainController
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

    The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

  name: IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox
  description: |+
    This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.

    The IsDefaultArbitrationMailbox switch configures this policy as the default retention policy for arbitration mailboxes in your Exchange Online organization. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

    This parameter isn't available in on-premises deployments.

  defaultValue: None

  name: RetentionId
  description: |+
    The RetentionId parameter specifies the identity of the retention policy to make sure mailboxes moved between two Exchange organizations continue to have the same retention policy applied to them. For example, in a cross-forest deployment or in a cross-premises deployment, when a mailbox is moved from an on-premises Exchange server to the cloud, or a cloud-based mailbox is moved to an on-premises Exchange server, this parameter is used to make sure the same retention policy is applied to the mailbox.

    It's not normally required to specify or modify the RetentionId parameter for a retention tag. The parameter is populated automatically when importing retention tags using the Import-RetentionTags.ps1 script.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

- type: <xref href="RetentionPolicyTagIdParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: RetentionPolicyTagLinks
  description: |+
    The RetentionPolicyTagLinks parameter specifies the identity of retention policy tags to associate with the retention policy. Mailboxes that get a retention policy applied have retention tags linked with that retention policy.
