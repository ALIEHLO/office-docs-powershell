### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Online Protection.

  Use the New-EOPDistributionGroup cmdlet to create distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups in standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes. This cmdlet isn't available in EOP that's included with Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services licenses in on-premises Exchange; use the New-DistributionGroup cmdlet instead.

  Typically, standalone EOP organizations that also have on-premises Active Directory use directory synchronization to create users and groups in EOP. However, if you can't use directory synchronization, then you can use cmdlets to create and manage users and groups in EOP.

  This cmdlet uses a batch processing method that results in a propagation delay of a few minutes before the results of the cmdlet are visible.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Alias
  description: |+
    The Alias parameter specifies the email alias of the distribution group. The Alias parameter value is used to generate the primary SMTP email address if you don't use the PrimarySmtpAddress parameter. The maximum length is 64 characters.

    The Alias value can contain letters, numbers and the following characters:

    - !, #, %, \*, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, \_, and ~.
    - $, &, ', \`, {, }, and \| need to be escaped (for example ``-Alias what`'snew``) or the entire value enclosed in single quotation marks (for example, `-Alias 'what'snew'`). The & character is not supported in the Alias value for Azure AD Connect synchronization.
    - Periods (.) must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`).
    - Unicode characters U+00A1 to U+00FF.

    If you don't use the Alias parameter when you create a group, the value of the Name parameter is used for the alias. This value is also used in the primary SMTP email address. Spaces are removed and unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?).

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisplayName
  description: |+
    The DisplayName parameter specifies the name of the distribution group in the Exchange admin center (EAC). If the DisplayName parameter isn't specified, the value of the Name parameter is used for the DisplayName parameter.

  defaultValue: None

  - Exchange Online Protection
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ManagedBy
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The ManagedBy parameter specifies a user who owns the group. You need to use this parameter to specify at least one group owner. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the user. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can specify multiple owners by using the following syntax: `@("User1","User2",..."UserN")`.

    The users you specify with this parameter aren't automatically added to the group. To add members to the group, use the Update-EOPDistributionGroupMember cmdlet.

    The Members parameter specifies the initial list of recipients (mail-enabled objects) in the distribution group. In Exchange Online Protection, the valid recipient types are:

    - Mail users
    - Distribution groups
    - Mail-enabled security groups

    You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

    - Name
    - Alias
    - Distinguished name (DN)
    - Canonical DN
    - Email address
    - GUID

    You can specify multiple recipients by using the following syntax: `@("Recipient1","Recipient2",..."RecipientN")`.

name: New-EOPDistributionGroup
description: |-
  You can use the New-EOPDistributionGroup cmdlet to create the following types of groups:

  - Mail-enabled universal security group (USG)
  - Universal distribution group

  Distribution groups are used to consolidate groups of recipients into a single point of contact for email messages. Security groups are used to grant permissions to multiple users.

  You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).
