### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a Location Information Server (LIS) port, creates an association between a port and a location (creating a new location if that location doesn't exist), or modifies an existing port and its associated location. The association between a port and location is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.

description: |-
  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information. In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors. The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location. This cmdlet allows the administrator to map physical locations to the port through which the client is connected.

  If a location with an address exactly matching the address parameters entered here (including null values) does not exist in the location database, a new address will be created based on the parameters entered with this cmdlet. (You can retrieve a list of locations by calling the \`Get-CsOnlineLisLocation\` cmdlet.) The \`Set-CsOnlineLisPort\` cmdlet does require or prompt for location parameters. A valid location consists of, at minimum, the Location, HouseNumber, StreetName, City, State and Country. If you do not supply all of these parameters, calls that are received by the referenced port may not contain the information required by the emergency operator (depending on whether valid settings are available for a switch, subnet, or wireless access point that can be used in place of port settings). It is recommended that you be as specific as possible with the location parameters and fill in as many as possible.
