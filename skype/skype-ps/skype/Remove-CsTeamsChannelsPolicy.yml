    Unique identifier for the policy to be removed.
    To "remove" the global policy, use the following syntax: `-Identity global`.
    (Note that the global policy cannot actually be removed.  Instead, all the properties in that policy will be reset to their default values.) To remove a per-user policy, use syntax similar to this: `-Identity "StudentPolicy"`.
    You cannot use wildcards when specifying a policy Identity.
