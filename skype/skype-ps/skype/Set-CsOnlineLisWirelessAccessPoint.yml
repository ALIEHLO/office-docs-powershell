### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates a Location Information Server (LIS) wireless access point (WAP), creates an association between a WAP and a location (creating a new location if that location doesn't exist), or modifies an existing WAP and its associated location. The association between a WAP and location is used in an Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) Enterprise Voice implementation to notify an emergency services operator of the caller's location.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BSSID
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) of the wireless access point. This value must be in the form nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn, such as 12-34-56-78-90-ab. If an entry with the specified BSSID value does not exist, a new WAP location will be created. If an entry with the specified BSSID already exists, that entry will be replaced. It can be presented in wildcard format. The wildcard '*' can be on either the last one or two character(s).

description: |-
  Enhanced 9-1-1 allows an emergency operator to identify the location of a caller without having to ask the caller for that information. In the case where a caller is calling from a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connection, that information must be extracted based on various connection factors. The VoIP administrator must configure a location map (called a wiremap) that will determine a caller's location. This cmdlet allows the administrator to map physical locations to the WAP through which calls will be routed.

  The BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifiers) is used to describe sections of a wireless local area network. It is the MAC of the 802.11 side of the access point. The BSSID parameter in this command also supports the wildcard format to cover all BSSIDs in a range which share the same description and Location ID. The wildcard '*' can be on either the last one or two character(s).

  If a BSSID with wildcard format is already existing, the request for adding one more new BSSID which is within this wildcard range and with the same location ID will not be accepted.
