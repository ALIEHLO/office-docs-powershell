  description: |+
    The ConferenceMode parameter indicates whether or not Conference mode will be applied on calls for this Call queue. Conference mode significantly reduces the amount of time it takes for a caller to be connected to an agent, after the agent accepts the call. The following bullet points detail the difference between both modes:

    - Conference Mode Disabled: CQ call is presented to agent. Agent answers and media streams are setup. Based on geographic location of the CQ call and agent, there may be a slight delay in setting up the media streams which may result in some dead air and the first part of the conversation being cut off.

    - Conference Mode Enabled: CQ call is put into conference. Agent answers and is brought into conference. Media streams are already setup when agent is brought into conference thus no dead air, and first bit of conversation will not be cut off.

  Set-CsCallQueue cmdlet provides a way for you to modify the properties of an existing Call Queue; for example, you can change the name for the Call Queue, the distribution lists associated with the Call Queue, or the welcome audio file. 

  The Set-CsCallQueue cmdlet may suggest additional steps required to complete the Call Queue setup.

  Note that this cmdlet is in the Skype for Business Online PowerShell module and also affects Teams. The reason the "Applies To:" is stated as Skype for Business Online is because it must match the actual module name of the cmdlet. To learn how this cmdlet is used with Skype for Business Online and Teams, see https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/create-a-phone-system-call-queue.
