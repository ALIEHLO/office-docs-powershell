    The command shown in Example 1 enables federation with Windows Live for the tenant with the tenant ID bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354.
    Because Windows Live is the only provider specified, both the AOL and Yahoo providers will be disabled after the command executes.

    For example, this syntax enables only Yahoo, while disabling Windows Live and AOL:

    `-Provider "Yahoo"`

description: |-
  Public providers are organizations that provide SIP communication services for the general public.
  When you establish a federation relationship with a public provider, you effectively establish federation with any user who has an account hosted by that provider.
  For example, if you federate with Windows Live, then your users will be able to exchange instant messages and presence information with anyone who has a Windows Live instant messaging account.

  Skype for Business Online gives administrators the option of configuring federation with one or more of the following public IM and presence providers:

  Windows Live

  AOL

  Yahoo!

  The `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider` cmdlet can be used to enable or disable federation with any of these public providers.
  When using this cmdlet, keep in mind that each time you run the `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider` cmdlet you must specify all of the providers that should be enabled.
  For example, suppose all three providers are disabled and you run this command:

  `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider -Tenant "bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354" -Provider "WindowsLive"`

  As you might expect, that will enable Windows Live, and will leave AOL and Yahoo disabled.

  Now, suppose you next run this command:

  `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider -Tenant "bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354" -Provider "AOL"`

  That command will enable AOL.
  However, it will also disable Windows Live: that's because Windows Live was not specified as part of the parameter value supplied to the Provider parameter.
  If you want to enable AOL and keep Windows Live enabled as well, then you must specify both AOL and Windows Live when calling Set-CsTenantPublicProvider:

  `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider -Tenant "bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354" -Provider "AOL","WindowsLive"`

  To disable federation for all three providers, set the Provider property to an empty string (""):

  `Set-CsTenantPublicProvider -Tenant "bf19b7db-6960-41e5-a139-2aa373474354" -Provider ""`

  Note that simply enabling the status of a public provider does not mean that users can exchange instant messages and presence information with users who have accounts on that provider.
  In addition to enabling federation with the provider itself, administrators must also set the AllowPublicUsers property of the federation configuration settings to True.
  If this property is set to False then communication will not be allowed with any of the public providers, regardless of the public provider configuration settings.
